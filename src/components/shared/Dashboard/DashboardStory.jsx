            Doctor.online began as a simple but powerful idea in the mind of a
            19-year-old named Kapil in 2024. One day, Kapil accompanied his
            mother to a hospital to get her medicine. What he expected to be a
            quick visit transformed into a long, exhausting five-hour wait.
            Sitting in those crowded hospital corridors, Kapil realized how
            frustrating it must be for countless people facing the same problem
            every day. Determined to solve this issue, Kapil decided to create a
            website where people could easily book doctor appointments online,
            much like Practo. He threw himself into learning how to code,
            spending late nights watching tutorials and writing lines of code.
            Despite his hard work, he struggled with debugging, which often left
            him feeling stuck and discouraged. Feeling isolated, Kapil reached
            out for help and came across Smarth, a talented developer who ran
            his own agency. Smarth understood Kapil's vision and saw its
            potential to change lives. Together, they combined Kapil’s
            determination and fresh ideas with Smarth’s technical expertise and
            business experience. The journey was anything but easy. They faced
            countless hurdles, from technical roadblocks to moments of doubt.
            But working together, they built Doctor.online — a platform designed
            to help millions avoid long waits and book doctor visits
            conveniently from home. By 2025, Doctor.online had become a beacon
            of hope for patients and doctors alike, transforming healthcare
            access across the country.
