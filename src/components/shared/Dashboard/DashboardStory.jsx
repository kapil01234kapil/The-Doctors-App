           The Doctors app began as a simple but powerful idea in the mind of a
19-year-old named Kapil in 2024. One day, Kapil accompanied his
mother to a hospital to get her medicine. What he expected to be a
quick visit transformed into a long, exhausting five-hour wait.
Sitting in those crowded hospital corridors, Kapil realized how
frustrating it must be for countless people facing the same problem
every day. Determined to solve this issue, Kapil decided to create a
website where people could easily book doctor appointments online,
much like Practo. He threw himself into learning how to code,
spending late nights watching tutorials and writing lines of code.
Despite his hard work, he struggled with debugging, which often left
him feeling stuck and discouraged. Feeling isolated, Kapil reached
out for help and came across Samarth, a talented developer who ran
his own agency. Samarth understood Kapil's vision and saw its
potential to change lives. Together, they combined Kapil’s
determination and fresh ideas with Samarth’s technical expertise and
business experience. The journey was anything but easy. They faced
countless hurdles, from technical roadblocks to moments of doubt.
But working together, they built The Doctors app — a platform designed
to help millions avoid long waits and book doctor visits
conveniently from home. By 2025, The Doctors app had become a beacon
of hope for patients and doctors alike, transforming healthcare
access across the country.
